This paper reviews current state-of-the-art of manipulation and grasping applications that involve artificial sense of touch and discusses pros and cons of each technique. The main issues of artificial tactile sensing are addressed. General requirements of a tactile sensor are briefly discussed and the main transduction technologies are analyzed. Twenty eight various tactile sensors, each integrated into a robot hand, are classified in accordance with their transduction types and applications. Previously issued reviews are focused on hardware part of tactile sensors, whereas we present an overview of algorithms and tactile feedback-based control systems that exploit signals from the sensors. The applications of these algorithms include grasp stability estimation, tactile object recognition, tactile servoing and force control.

	abstract = {To perform robust grasping, a multi-fingered robotic hand should be able to adapt its grasping configuration, i.e., how the object is grasped, to maintain the stability of the grasp. Such a change of grasp configuration is called grasp adaptation and it depends on the controller, the employed sensory feedback and the type of uncertainties inherit to the problem. This paper proposes a grasp adaptation strategy to deal with uncertainties about physical properties of objects, such as the object weight and the friction at the contact points. Based on an object-level impedance controller, a grasp stability estimator is first learned in the object frame. Once a grasp is predicted to be unstable by the stability estimator, a grasp adaptation strategy is triggered according to the similarity between the new grasp and the training examples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the grasping performance on novel objects with different physical properties from those used for training. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {— During grasping and other in-hand manipulation tasks maintaining a stable grip on the object is crucial for the task's outcome. Inherently connected to grip stability is the concept of slip. Slip occurs when the contact between the fingertip and the object is partially lost, resulting in sudden undesired changes to the objects state. While several approaches for slip detection have been proposed in the literature, they frequently rely on previous knowledge of the manipulated object. This previous knowledge may be unavailable, seeing that robots operating in real-world scenarios often must interact with previously unseen objects. In our work we explore the generalization capabilities of well known supervised learning methods, using random forest classifiers to create generalizable slip predictors. We utilize these classifiers in the feedback loop of an object stabilization controller. We show that the controller can successfully stabilize previously unknown objects by predicting and counteracting slip events.},

If robots are to match human abilities and learn to pick up never-before-seen objects, they must combine vision with tactile sensing. This paper present a novel way to improve robotic grasping: by using tactile sensors and an unsupervised feature-learning approach, a robot can find the common denominators behind successful and failed grasps, and use this knowledge to predict whether a grasp attempt will succeed or fail. This method is promising as it uses only high-level features from two tactile sensors to evaluate grasp quality, and works for the training set as well as for new objects. In total, using a total of 54 different objects, our system recognized grasp failure 83.70{\%} of time.},

	abstract = {A successful grasp requires careful balancing of the contact forces. Deducing whether a particular grasp will be successful from indirect measurements, such as vision, is therefore quite challenging, and direct sensing of contacts through touch sensing provides an appealing avenue toward more successful and consistent robotic grasping. However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other modalities. Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally difficult. In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that combines vision and touch. To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and from both modalities together. Our experimental results indicate that incorporating tactile readings substantially improve grasping performance.},

The DNN is trained to classify whether a slip occurred or not. To evaluate the performance of the DNN, we test 10 unseen objects in 152 grasps. A detection accuracy as high as 88.03{\%} is achieved.

In this paper, we develop a novel optical-based tactile sensor "FingerVision" with effective signal processing algorithms. This sensor is composed of soft skin with embedded marker array bonded to rigid frame, and a web camera with a fisheye lens. While being excited with contact force, the camera tracks the movements of markers and deformation field is obtained. Compared to existing tactile sensors, our sensor features compact footprint, high resolution, and ease of fabrication. Besides, utilizing the deformation field estimation, we propose a slip classification framework based on convolution Long Short Term Memory (convolutional LSTM) networks. The data collection process takes advantage of the human sense of slip, during which human hand holds 12 daily objects, interacts with sensor skin and labels data with a slip or non-slip identity based on human feeling of slip. Our slip classification framework performs high accuracy of 97.62{\%} on the test dataset. It is expected to be capable of enhancing the stability of robot grasping significantly, leading to better contact force control, finer object interaction and more active sensing manipulation.},
